    "title": "How to Start Shadow Work",
    "text": "1. Decide if you'll seek therapy or do shadow work on your own\nYou don't have to seek out a therapist to do shadow work. However, it can be helpful to have someone else to guide you through the process. A trained professional can spot patterns within you that you may not be aware of. They can also give you the tools you'll need to deal with any triggers you may uncover. Plus, therapists can provide you with personalized prompts to guide you through your shadow work journey.\n\n2. Practice spotting your inner shadow\nTo start shadow work, it's important to spot your inner shadow. To do this, you can start by spotting habits you may have. Habits can be good, but they can also be bad. What patterns do you tend to replicate repeatedly in your life that you feel are holding you back? You should also pay attention to your triggers to spot your shadow. Triggers remind you of past trauma, which is usually associated with your shadow. Those triggers are messages to help you realize your shadow wants to be seen. Finally, you can spot your shadow by noticing yourself projecting. One way you can do this is by using the mirror technique. This technique can be uncomfortable at first. However, it can allow you to uncover who your shadow self really is. To practice the mirror technique, pay attention to how you think and feel when you interact with others. When negative feelings come up, ask yourself if you may be projecting. Here's an example. Let's say you're talking to a friend, and they start taking over the conversation. You're struggling to put a word in. You may start to judge this behavior and get upset. But perhaps this could be a projection of the shame you feel when you want to speak up and don't.\n\n3. Think back to your childhood\nExplore what parts of you may have been treated as bad or lesser when you were a child. Which emotions were you punished for having? Many children get told to “get over” their anger or sadness. As a result, those emotions get repressed. We grow up believing they're bad and that we're bad for having them.\n\n4. Avoid shaming (or being ashamed of) your shadow\nSome people might say that your shadow longs for acceptance. But really, your shadow is you and we all long to feel whole so it is more that we long to feel integrated, whole, and complete in our lives. Embrace your shadow and have some compassion for yourself. Remember that it's tough not to feel accepted, including (or especially) by yourself. Practice loving words of affirmation toward yourself (including your shadow). Some examples include:\nI trust in you\nI believe in you\nI'm glad that you're in my life\nYou are worthy of love\nYou are enough\nYou deserve to be happy\nYou have a lot to offer\n\n5. Meditate to observe your triggers\nNotice the triggers that cause emotional reactions within you. Then, you can meditate on them so that you can step back and observe what's happening. Observe without being judgemental. When emotions come up, allow yourself to have them.\n\n6. Keep a shadow journal\nA shadow journal is a safe and practical way to express all sides of yourself. You can let out your thoughts, both light and dark, using the written word. Make it a daily practice to sit down and write in your journal. Don't censor yourself. Write whatever comes up without overthinking it. At first, what comes up may feel uncomfortable, but it's important to lean into it if you want your shadow self to feel heard.\n\n7. Express your inner shadow artistically\nArt is a powerful way to let your shadow self express itself. It can be especially beneficial if journaling isn't the way you prefer to express yourself. According to recent research, art therapy can even be used to treat pre-verbal trauma. Allow yourself to feel all the emotions you need to feel when you're creating art, even if they're dark. Express them while using the medium of your choice. This can be painting, sculpture, singing, digital art, music, or anything else you feel called to try. Don't be afraid to be spontaneous. Create what your inner self wants to create, no matter what it looks like.\n\n8. Start an inner dialogue\nYou can learn from your shadow by having an inner conversation with it. To do this, you can use a process similar to meditation. Ask your shadow some questions and wait for an answer. Keep an open mind, even if it feels weird. Take note of the answer and make sure that you're listening without judgment."

    "title": "The benefits of shadow work and how to use it in your journey",
    "text": "We all have traits that we're proud of, and traits that we don't feel so confident about. Some of these traits may trigger or embarrass us, so we hide them from public view. These parts make up your shadow self, and it longs to be heard.\nBut repressing your inner shadow can have dangerous consequences. Most often, the shadow manifests as our triggers — emotional reactions that we haven't fully dealt with, but bubble up to the surface under the right (wrong) circumstances. It takes training, self-awareness, guidance, and courage to help you face your shadow self in a healthy way.\nYour inner shadow is composed of parts of you that you subconsciously reject.\nFor example, say that you were often teased for being talkative as a child. Believing that you “talk too much,” you start retreating within, weighing every conversation to see if you “did it again.” One day, someone makes an innocuous comment while you're preparing for a presentation: “Be careful not to put too many words on that slide” — and you're furious.\n\nHow your inner shadow affects you\n\nYour shadow side can have a negative impact on your well-being when you ignore or reject it.\nThis can lead to issues like:\nSelf-loathing or poor self-esteem\nSelf-deceit and deceiving others\nAnxiety and depression\nOffensive behavior toward others\nStruggling to have healthy relationships with others\nSelf-sabotage\nSelf-absorption\nAn inflated ego\n\nSo, what is shadow work?\nWorking with your unconscious mind to uncover the parts of yourself that you repress and hide from yourself. This can include trauma or parts of your personality that you subconsciously consider undesirable.\nYour shadow isnt a flaw or a mistake — instead, it's a natural part of who you are. Shadow work is, at heart, about developing self-awareness and ultimately, self-acceptance and compassion. Shadow work is often both therapy and more spiritual, helping you see the different parts of yourself.\n\n8 benefits of shadow work\n\nYou can benefit from practicing shadow work in several different aspects of your life.\n1. Gain more confidence and self-esteem\nYou can show up more confidently when you show up as the full version of yourself, shadow and all. There's no more hidden self-doubt about parts of yourself that you may dislike or even loathe. This means you can be more confident as you move forward to achieve your goals. Most of the time, our shadow traits are actually valuable parts of our personality. But if they are truly weaknesses, you're better able to address them when you bring them out into the light so you can understand (and maybe better manage) them. Our shadow is most problematic when we aren't even aware of it.\n\n2. Improve your creativity\nYour shadow doesn't just hide traits that people consider undesirable. It can also hide amazing parts of yourself, like creativity. Accepting your shadow means you get to embrace your creative side. Instead of suppressing your darker self, you can fully tap into all of the unique expressions it hides.\n\n3. Build better relationships with others\nOnly when you fully love and accept yourself can you fully love and accept others. When you tame your projections, you can see others for who they really are. You no longer see them as projections of the side of you that you dislike. As a result, you can build stronger bonds with them.\n\n4. Practice self-acceptance\nYou can get rid of the self-loathing you may unconsciously have when you repress your shadow. But you can only do this by fully accepting that side of yourself and practicing self-awareness. Accepting your shadow means accepting and feeling self-compassion for every aspect of yourself. It won't necessarily come easily and automatically. But beginning shadow work opens the door for you to get there.\n\n5. Discover your hidden talents\nYou can use shadow work to uncover what some people call the 'gold in your shadow bags' — in other words, your inner strengths and resources that you didn't realize you had before. Some people may fear that their shadow contains too much darkness for them to overcome. But in most cases, this golden shadow takes up most of the space. It just never had an opportunity to thrive before. Shadow work can tempt this side of yourself out of hiding and allow you to step into everything you can really do.\n\n6. Improve your overall wellness\nRepressing your shadow can lead to all sorts of problems. You may not even realize these problems stem from a repressed side of yourself until you're ready to face that shadow. Shadow work can help you take control of your wellness journey by starting at the root. Instead of addressing specific wellness issues, like anxiety or unhealthy relationships, shadow work tackles their root causes.\n\n7. Increase your compassion toward others\nShadow work helps you reduce projection when you interact with others. You're less likely to be triggered by other people's personality traits and quirks. In turn, this can help you feel more compassionate toward others. You no longer see the dark side of yourself reflected in others. Instead, you can see them as whole people who likely have their own inner battles to face.\n\n8. Have better clarity\nShadow work gives you better clarity on how your thoughts, emotions, and feelings lead you to act the way you do. When you have this information, you can show up with more clarity and authenticity.\n"

    "text": "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

    "text": "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
