# GETTING STARTED

This web application was built using:

* React
* Bulma CSS
* JSON
* Node.js

To run the program, type:

##### `npm start`
then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### NOTE: Please check for the Journal server [here](https://github.com/121Unicorns/journal-backend) as it is the backend and a companion to this project. No journal entries will load or be created unless the server is also running. I will also be adding the server-api to this repository.

* Create a new journal entry
* Retrieve and view all journal entries
